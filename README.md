# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to not only learn the basics of coding, but also provide a place to take and access notes regarding the prework for coding bootcamp.
This will be a place I can log important notes and learning experiences.
I have learned some very basic HTML, CSS, attempted to learn JavaScript, and compiled them into a single project here.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section will contain notes based on the applicable coding system. Using Chrome DevTools, the console log will be where you can see JavaScript in action. Not only will it list the four systems we will learn in bootcmap, it will also choose a topic at random to study first.
